# TikZ-trackschematic

------------

# Installation

The tikz library is contained in the files:
* tikz-trackschematic.sty
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.code.tex,
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.topology.code.tex,
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.trafficcontrol.code.tex,
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.vehicles.code.tex,
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.constructions.code.tex,
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.electrics.code.tex, and
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.measures.code.tex.

These files should be copied wherever TeX can find it, for example in your $TEXMF folder.
The library can then be loaded through the command
```TeX
\usepackage{tikz-trackschematic}
```
in any LaTeX file.

# Minimal working example

```TeX
\documentclass{standalone}
\usepackage{tikz-trackschematic}
\begin{document}

  \begin{tikzpicture}

    \coordinate (A)   at (0,0);
    \coordinate (B)   at (6,0);
    \coordinate (T)   at (5,0);

    \maintrack (A) -- (B);
    \train[forward] at (T) label (train);

  \end{tikzpicture}

\end{document}
```
results in:

![train on a track](https://glossary.ivev.bau.tu-bs.de/tiki-download_file.php?fileId=28&display&scale=.4 "train on a track")

# Symbology and meaning

A transnational symbol library with common traits of railway operation. 
A [glossary](https://glossary.ivev.bau.tu-bs.de/tiki-index.php?page=_Symbology) for further information regarding meaning of the symbols.
