# TikZ-trackschematic

------------

# Installation

The tikz library is contained in the files:
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.code.tex,
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.topology.code.tex,
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.trafficcontrol.code.tex,
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.vehicles.code.tex,
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.constructions.code.tex, and
* tikzlibrarytrackschematic.messures.code.tex.
These files should be copied wherever TeX can find it, for example in your TEXMF folder. The library can then be loaded through the command \usetikzlibrary{trackschematic} in any tex file.

# Usage

```TeX
\documentclass[tikz]{standalone}
\usetikzlibrary{trackschematic}
\begin{document}

  \begin{tikzpicture}

    \coordinate (A)   at (0,0);
    \coordinate (B)   at (6,0);
    \coordinate (T)   at (5,0);

    \maintrack (A) -- (B);
    \train[forward] at (T) label (train);
